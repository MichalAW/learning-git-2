			<p>Load up on guns bring your friends.
				It's fun to lose and to pretend.
				She's over-bored and self-assured.
				Oh no, I know a dirty word.

			<p>`m worse at what I do best 
				And for this gift I feel blessed. 
				Our little group has always been 
				And always will until the end. 
			</p>
			<p>With the lights out, it's less dangerous
				Here we are now; entertain us
				I feel stupid and contagious
				Here we are now; entertain us
				A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
